# AFG

A composable application that simulates an Autonomous Floating Greenhouse.

This repository is a collection of simulated sensors and hubs that can be
built into a number of different cloud hosted applications. Given the simulated
nature of this repository, we are solely focusing on IoT software development.

### What is an AFG

AFG stands for an Autonomous Floating Greenhouse. This is a hypothetical IoT
system that has the sole purpose of growing produce while floating on some body
of water, without human intervention. For our purposes with this and related
repositories, we are assuming AFGs have the following capabilities:

- Robust worldwide networking
- Create clean water from hosting water source
- Navigation and propulsion systems
- Harvest solar energy with efficient battery storage
- Automatic landfall with a produce supply
- Exchange produce for moneys

### Architecture

Please consult the [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for details on AFG
architecture.

### Deploy

Please read the general deployment overview and steps outlined in
[DEPLOY.md](./DEPLOY.md) for details on deploying an AFG.
